# interphase

interphase is a open-source mechanical keyboard.
Kudos to reversebias, as I got inspired by his fascinating mitosis keyboard (https://github.com/reversebias/mitosis-hardware).
The only problem was the lack of keys for a full german layout + number row.

Therefor, interphase is a kind of ISO-compatible layout with some minor modifications.
